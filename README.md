# Chess and Artificial Intelligence

A simple chess program built as my thesis project, implemented in C# using the Unity game engine.

This project is heavily based on [Sebastian Lague's Chess-AI](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-AI).
It also includes a fork of Fathom, a Syzygy tablebase probing tool, as a DLL built from [here](https://github.com/mviktor02/Fathom).
